Wuxiang Lin
===

I grew up in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. I spent 4 years studying Microwave
Engineering in [UESTC](http://uestc.edu.cn), Chengdu, China. By then, I was hoping to
enter telecommunication industry. Along my study, I learned to appreciate the
beauty of software. Eventually, I became a self-taught software engineer, and I
am still in the stage of early-immediate level.

Now I am a graduate student in UESTC. Currently, I am studying toward a Master's
degree in Microwave Engineering, doing researches on Computational
Electromagnetism. But I sincerely believe I won't enter the either field of
telecommunication or academia of electromagnetism ...
