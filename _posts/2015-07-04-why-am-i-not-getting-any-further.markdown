## 1. Current Snapshot of Me

It is a lot of dissatisfaction around the period of time in graduate school. I
have been working on verious things but I am quite unhappy about what I am
working on. Now, I ask the question: why i am not getting any further with my
work and personal life?

I often work on certain things that I think may help with my mentalality and
emotionality. I hope my study on logics and rational thinking may provide
insights on the my future. I believe they did help but not these things won't
comfort me substantially.

## 2. Current Reasoning of Me

I think most of my disappointments are caused by the fact that the work I had
done create zero value besides some technological achievement I felt inside
myself (the degree of credibility of achievement is not resolved though). The
market value made in my personal projects are either zero or not sustainable for
my personal reach.

Because of financial limitation, I felt especially limited (I felt I have very
little confidence to give up something I am not very passionate about,
especially in school. Even though I usually take much more risks on school
related things than my classmates). I reckon that if I get a lot of money, I
will be freer (I believe that is true).
