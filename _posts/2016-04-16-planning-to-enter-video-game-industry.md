A few days ago, I received message from Game Department of
[NetEase](http://game.163.com/), which told me my resume was passing through.
Since I'd been working on game-related projects for some time (spanning 3 years
now). It is the first time I get the formal external confirmation of my skills
and experience for game programming.

I think it is happening.

While I am still aware of deficiency of mine in some Computer Science subjects
and I don't have a major in Computer Science, that is not a huge obstacle for me
now.
