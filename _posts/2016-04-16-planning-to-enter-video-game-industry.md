A few days ago, I received the message from
[NetEase Gaming Division](http://game.163.com/), which told me my resume was

of my skills and experience for game programming.

I think it is happening.

While I am still aware of deficiency of mine in some Computer Science subjects
and I don't have a degree in Computer Science, that is not a huge obstacle for
me personally now.
