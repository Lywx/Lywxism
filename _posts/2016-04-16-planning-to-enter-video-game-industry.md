A few days ago, I received the message from 
[NetEase Gaming Division](http://game.163.com/), which told me my resume was
passing through. Since I'd been working on game-related projects (spanning
nearly 3 years now), it is the first time I get the formal external confirmation
of my skills and experience for game programming.

I think it is happening.

While I am still aware of deficiency of mine in some Computer Science subjects
and I don't have a degree in Computer Science, that is not a huge obstacle for
me personally now.
