A few days ago, I received message from Game Department of
[NetEase](http://game.163.com/), which tells me my resume is passing through.
Since I'd been working on game-related projects for some time (spanning 3 years
now), it is the first time I get the formal external confirmation of my skills
and experience for game programming.

I think it is happening.

While I am still aware of deficiency of mine in some major Computer Science
subject and I don't have a major in Computer Science, that is not a huge
obstacle for me now.
