## 1. Introduction

The previously introduced knowledge management is proved to be ineffective in
terms of flexibility and effectivity. Even though as I later introduced audio
narrative for the key sentence of the specific piece of knowledge entry, it is
still incredibly cumbersome to use. At some extent, I believed it even
harmfully introduces some overhead to an already task-overloaded mind. So the
last project has failed through my trial.

Inspired by the TDD (Test Driven Development), based on which further idea like
automatic testing and CTTD (Continuous test-driven development) are developed. I
found these idea could be useful as a check-list like thinking tools.

Since the fundamental practice in TDD is to ensure the tests passed.
